# Analysing_Data_A3_Resist
This repository contains files for resist of **Assignment 3 for Analysing Data: LDA Topic Modeling**.

## Repository Introduction
`Assignment3_AD_resit_S5716683.ipynb` records the codes and interpretations of the analysis, trying to answer the two research questions regarding Trump and Sander's tweets whether reflect their standpoints of right-wing populism or left-wing populism.

`sanders_tweets.csv` and `trump_tweets.csv` are materials for analysing.

`sanders_trump_tweets.csv` is a combined file generated during the analysis.

`Topic_Modeling_tomotopy.ipynb` is a lab material which is very instructive during topic modeling learning.

## Research Questions
1. What topics are revolving around Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders' posts separately?
2. What are the topic differences between Trump (right-wing popoulist) and Sanders (left-wing populist)?

## My Findings
1. Trump's tweet topics focus more on Iran, military, fake news, vote and collusion matters, these topics include country-level issues and personal issues. On the other hand, Sanders seems to focus more on the president matter.
2. My analysis doesn't show a significant difference between the topics of two politicians regarding populism, but Trump tends to post tweets more about his personal matters than Sanders.
3. For topic modeling, I find that the possibility of the coherence score growth could be achieved by increasing more topics.

**Note:**

- In `Assignment3_AD_resit_S5716683.ipynb`, I used words in green to give some comments per A3's assignment requirement.

- There are three overlapping numbers **[10], [11], [12]** as you may notice, this is because I did this assignment and run the codes several times. On May 18, I run Q1-Q3 again for double check, thus the overlapping numbers in the procedure occur.
